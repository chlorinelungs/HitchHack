# HitchHack
A Minor Variant of Splicehack made by AntiGulp

## New Features
- New 3 Playable Races: Goblin, Kobold, Gnolls

### Required Files
* Lua 5.4.3

### Installation (Unix Only Currently)
- in the root directory create a file path ~/spl/install/games/lib/splicehackdir
- tar lua 5.4.3 into lib so it resembles ~/HitchHack/lib/lua-5.4.3
- run the ./setup.sh inside of ~/HitcHack/sys/unix using /hints/ as an input like so "~/HitcHack/sys/unix/hints/your-unix-system"
- move in ~/HitchHack/src and run 'make' and 'make install' inside of "~/HitchHack"

this is a very minor variant but any suggestions and criticisms are welcomed!
