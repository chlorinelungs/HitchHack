# HitchHack
A Minor Variant of Splicehack made by AntiGulp

## New Features
- New 3 Playable Races: Goblin, Kobold, Gnolls

## Installation (Unix Only Currently)

### Required Files
Lua 5.4.3

### Compile Instructions
- in the root directory create a file path ~/spl/install/games/lib/splicehackdir
- tar lua 5.4.3 into lib so it resembles ~/HitchHack/lib/lua-5.4.3
- run the ./setup.sh inside of /HitcHack/sys/unix using the hints dir as an input like so /HitcHack/sys/unix/hints/your-unix-system
- move into /HitchHack/src and run 'make' and 'make install' inside of /HitchHack/

this is a very minor variant but any suggestions and criticisms are welcome!
